# CCDA_OMOP_by_Python
Following initial explorations suggesting Python is useful for converting JSON to OMOP, this project does it from CCDA XML. It also considers the mapping from XPaths in the CCDA specification to Python paths and how we might convert between them. 

## Simple examples for learning, playing with Xpath etc.
- resources/sample.xml Country data copied from the XML etree docs. State and city data added for deeper exploration of the tools.
- resources/sample_paths.txt
- /sample.py  This is code wired to the above files.
